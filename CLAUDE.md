# MANDATORY: Spec Workflow

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST read `.spec/WORKFLOW.md` before starting any feature development.**

The spec workflow is mandatory for all feature development. It ensures systematic, high-quality implementation through defined phases:
1. Architecture Analysis
2. Feature Creation  
3. Research
4. Requirements
5. Design
6. Tasks
7. Implementation

See `.spec/WORKFLOW.md` for complete details.
